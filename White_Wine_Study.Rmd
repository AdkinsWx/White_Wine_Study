> This tidy data set contains 4,898 red wines with 11 variables 
on the chemical properties of the wine. 
At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Here we will explore which chemical properties influence the taste of white wines.

# Univariate Plots Section


> First let's take a look at some of the variables
and see what the values look like'

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
names(winedf)
summary(winedf)
#X is not a useable variable so we will remove below
wines <- subset(winedf, select = -X)
head(wines)
```
> After removing the unneeded X variable, we can see
eleven attributes that may contribute to the taste
and quality rating of the wine.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1}
summary(wines$quality)
ggplot(wines, aes(quality))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

> Here we can see that the quality ranges from
3 to 9 with a mean rating of 5.878.
Next we'll plot an analyze resiudal sugars. This is 
the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, 
it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter 
and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet 
so we shouldn't expect many data points below 1.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_2}
summary(wines$residual.sugar)
ggplot(wines, aes(residual.sugar))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

> After plotting Residual Sugar within the wines we
can see that it is highly skewed to the left. We can also see that
we have no data points over 45 gram/liter ie sweet wines. However, it does appear that
we have quite a few data points near 1 gram/liter. Given this we'll next 
we'll plot just the bottom 95% to get a better grasp
of the distribution of residual sugars.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_3}
summary(subset(wines$residual.sugar,
               wines$residual.sugar <
                 quantile(wines$residual.sugar,
                          .95)))
ggplot(wines, aes(residual.sugar))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+
  xlim(0, quantile(wines$residual.sugar, .95))+
  xlab("residual.sugar (Lower 95%)")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wines$residual.sugar), color = 'blue')+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(wines$residual.sugar), color = 'red')+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, color = 'green')
```

> After plotting the lower 95% we still have a skewed distribution.
But this graph does reveal more information. First, the vertical green line denotes 1 gram/liter of sugar.
Observing the the around this line reveals that we have many wines that according to the citations would be considered rare, given their sugar profile below 1 gram/liter. Previously, I found that Red wines in a similiar study 
had an average residual sugar count around 2.5 gram/liter and only one data point below 1 gram/liter. However, the white wine sugar profile is very different. As pointed out we have a noteworthy amount of white wines below 1 gram/liter, more than red wines, and an average of 5.77 gram/liter, higher than the red wines. This gives a distribution much wider and perhaps more complex in determing quality than the red wines.
Another thing to consider is the amount of observations. We have almost 5000 white wine observations vs the 1600 for the red wines. This is more than twice the amount of red wine observations and may have something to contribute towards the wider distribution.

> Let's progress to another variable, alcohol content. Again, because of the amount of observations we may see a wider distribution than previously observed in the last study.


```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_4}
summary(wines$alcohol)
ggplot(wines, aes(alcohol))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wines$alcohol), color ="blue")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(wines$alcohol), color='red')
```

> After plotting alcohol content we do see a more normalized distribution with a mean around 10.51%.
Now that we hyper focused on two variables lets create mutiple plots of the remaining variables and try to uncover any remaining anomolies worth exploring.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_5}
p1 <- qplot(wines$fixed.acidity)
p2 <- qplot(wines$volatile.acidity)
p3 <- qplot(wines$citric.acid)
p4 <- qplot(wines$chlorides)
p5 <- qplot(wines$free.sulfur.dioxide)
p6 <- qplot(wines$total.sulfur.dioxide)
p7 <- qplot(wines$density)

p8 <- qplot(wines$pH)
p9 <- qplot(wines$sulphates)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9, ncol = 3)
```

> After analyzing these plots most look well-behaved, ie normal distributions, aside from the sulphates. It appears that it may be slightly bimodal and is worth clarifying. We'll use RStudio's Hartigans dip.test function to test for unimodality/multimodality

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_6}
qplot(wines$sulphates, bins =30)
dip.test(wines$sulphates)
```
> After running the bimodal test we do return a D value of 0.0245. Note that any value less than 0.05 suggest significant bimodality.
This could suggest that we have two different populations of white wines with different average sulphate profiles. Using the information from the data citation material we can see that there are several different grapes used to create the white wines. Given this new observation we should pay careful attention when determing if sulphates influence the wine's quality. 

# Univariate Analysis



### What is the structure of your dataset?

In this data set there are 4898 observations with 12 attributes. Most of the variables are normal
distributions. With the exception of sulphates (bimodal). It is rare to find a white wine with residual sugar under 1gram/liter how ever our sample have quite a few data points under 1gram/liter. Also, wines with residual sugar around 45 g/l are consider sweet.
Our data set contains one wine over this threshold with a maximum residual sugar of 65.8 grams/liter meaning we do have one wine that would be consdiered sweet.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The quality variable captures my interest the most. Quality is scored between 0-10, with 0 being the worst
and 10 being the best. Our data set shows a min of 3 and a max of 9. I am interested in trying to find what
attributes contribute to a particular wine's score. 

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

After noticing that the sulphates have a bimodal distribution I am curious to see if this has an effect on the wine's quality. Also, when testing red wines alcohol made itself to be a reliable factor in determing the rating of the wine, I am curious if this is the case with our white wine sample as well.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?

# Bivariate Plots Section


> Next we will check the covariance between each of the variables.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_1}
round(cor(wines), 3)
ggpairs(wines)

```
> After viewing the above plot we can see some interesting correlation displayed graphically and with their corresponding correlation coefficient.

> First up we'll look at density. Most chemical elements have a slight to significant correlation with density. This makes physical sense as the addition of each chemical would add to the molar volume of the wine. according to the table residual sugars contribute most to density(correlation of 0.839) with free sulfur dioxide coming in a far second (0.294). The exception to the rule is alcohol with is negative correlation to denstisy (-0.78). This may be due to the chemical properties of alcohol being less dense than water/wine and thus the addition of alcohol and removal of water in a fixed volume would lower the density. 

> Next we'll pick out each correlation over 0.50, we'll considered 0.50-0.70 moderately correlated and anything over 0.70 will be strongly correlated. We'll try to focus on what effects our primary interest, quality, but we'll also pick up any other interesting relations and try to interpret their significance.


> First up we have is alcohol's relation to quality rating. The correlation coefficient is at 0.436, so it is under our range of 0.5 but it is the highest single relation we have to quality so we will study this further.



```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}
ggplot(wines, aes(x=alcohol, y =quality))+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.25)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")


```


> After plotting the alcohol/quality relationship and with the additional help from the trend line we can visually see that there is a positive correlation between them. However, this relationship is only moderately correlated and doesn't appear that alcohol content alone is enough to raise the quality rating of the wine. Given this insight we must seek a good starting point for our bivariate and multivariate analysis. So we'll plot a few more univariate plots before we move on to more complicated graphs.

> After denisty and acohol the dropoff in correlation ratios between the chemical properties and quality is very steep. So we'll start the next phase of univariate analysis by plotting denisty and remove the outliers to make the plot easier to interpret.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots_7}
p1 <- ggplot(wines, aes(x=density, y = quality))+
  geom_jitter(aplha = 0.25)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  xlim(0.99,1.003)

p2 <- ggplot(wines, aes(x = density, y= alcohol))+
  geom_jitter(aplha = 0.25)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  xlim(0.987, 1.003)

grid.arrange(p1, p2)
  
```
> After removing some outliers, the plots above show first "weak" negative correlation between quality and density and the rather strong correlation between alcohol and density. Density The latter plot agrees with the chemical properties of alcohol being less dense than water. The first graph between quality and denisty states a very small correlation between the two.

```{r Bivariate_Plots_8}

chlr_lim <- ggplot(wines, aes(x=chlorides, y=quality))+
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.25)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  xlim(0, 0.1)+
  ggtitle("X Limit at 0.100")
chlr <- ggplot(wines, aes(x=chlorides, y=quality))+
  geom_jitter(aplha= 0.25)+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")+
  ggtitle("No X Limit")

grid.arrange(chlr, chlr_lim)
  
```
> Next I plottted chlorides against quality. After alcohol and density, the amount of of chlorides present had the next stronget correlation value. Again it's good to note that this correlation is relatively weak and negative. This adds to the idea that there is not going to be one factor that will change the quality rating by it's own merit. Thus it will take a combination of two or more chemical properties to change the quality rating.

# Multivariate Plots Section

> Now we are going to progress to the mutlivariate analysis section. Here I hope to find a combination of chemical properties that will answer our original question of "What chemical properties determine quality?" with more conviction that what I have been able to supply thus far. Given that the bivaraite analysis yielded only weak correlation values it leads me to believe that a combination of chemical properties may be the right place to find a meaningful correlation value.


```{r Multivariate_Plots_1}
#Removing outliers from the variable chlorides to create a less noisy gradient plot
library(data.table)
outlierReplace = function(dataframe, cols, rows, newValue = NA) {
    if (any(rows)) {
        set(dataframe, rows, cols, newValue)
    }
}

my_data = wines

outlierReplace(my_data, "chlorides", which(my_data$chlorides > 0.1), NA)

ggplot(wines, aes(x= chlorides))+
  geom_histogram()
```

``` {r  Multivariate_Plots_2}


chlr_grad <- ggplot(wines, aes(x= alcohol, color= quality, y= chlorides))+
  geom_jitter()+
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red")

alcl_chlr <- ggplot(wines, aes(x= alcohol, chlorides))+
  geom_jitter()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

grid.arrange(alcl_chlr, chlr_grad)
  





```

> After removing the outliers from chlorides I created a bivariate plot with alcohol against chlorides and a scale_color_gradient plot in attempt to find an understanding between quality, alcohol, and chlorides. We can see that as alcohol content increases we get a decrease in the amount of chlorides present. This concurs with prior plots when you consider the following:
 1. Quality decreases as our chloride value increases
 2. Quality increases as our alcohol value increases
 
> Thus we would expect alcohol and chlorides to have an inverse relationship. Now when we look at our gradient graph we can see that quality increases as we move towards the bottom right of the plot. In other words as we increase alcohol content and decrease chlorides we should get a higher quality wine. It may be helpful to create a variable that represents a ratio of chlorides/alcohol and find the correlation between this new ratio and quality. If we can attain a higher correlation value we may be on the rght track.

```{r Multivariate_Plots_3}

wines$al_chlr <- (winedf$chlorides/winedf$alcohol)

ggplot(wines, aes(x = al_chlr, y = quality))+
  geom_jitter()+
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

cor.test(wines$al_chlr, wines$quality)
```
> After performing Pearson's correlation test we can see that my intuition was incorrect. The correlation value came to -0.263 (relatively weak) and was confirmed as a useable value by p-value < 2.2e-16 (much lower than typically accepted 0.05). Thus we must continue to further investigate what factors influence quality.
