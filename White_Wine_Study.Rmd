This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE)
# Load all of the packages that you end up using in your analysis in this code
# chunk.

# Notice that the parameter "echo" was set to FALSE for this code chunk. This
# prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output. You should set
# echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file, unless it makes sense for your
# report to show the code that generated a particular plot.

# The other parameters for "message" and "warning" should also be set to FALSE
# for other code chunks once you have verified that each plot comes out as you
# want it to. This will clean up the flow of your report.

> This tidy data set contains 4,898 red wines with 12 variables 
on the chemical properties of the wine. 
At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating 
between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).
Here we will explore which chemical properties influence the taste of red wines.

# Univariate Plots Section


> First let's take a look at some of the variables
and see what the values look like'

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}
names(winedf)
summary(winedf)
#X is not a useable variable so we will remove below
wines <- subset(winedf, select = -X)
head(wines)
```
> After removing the unneeded X variable, we can see
twelve attributes that may contribute to the taste
and quality rating of the wine.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1}
summary(wines$quality)
ggplot(wines, aes(quality))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```

>Here we can see that the quality ranges from
3 to 9 with a mean rating of 5.878.
Next we'll plot an analyze resiudal sugars. These
are the sugars that are left after over after red 
wines under 1 gram/liter so we shouldn't expect many
data points below or around 1.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_2}
summary(wines$residual.sugar)
ggplot(wines, aes(residual.sugar))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

>After plotting Residual Sugar within the wines we
can see that it is highly skewed to the right. Next 
we'll plot just the bottom 95% to get a better grasp
of the distribution of residual sugars'

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_3}
summary(subset(wines$residual.sugar,
               wines$residual.sugar <
                 quantile(wines$residual.sugar,
                          0.95)))
ggplot(wines, aes(residual.sugar))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)+
  xlim(0, quantile(wines$residual.sugar, 0.95))+
  xlab("residual.sugar (Lower 95%)")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wines$residual.sugar), color = 'blue')+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(wines$residual.sugar), color = 'red')
```

>After elimitating the tail we can see that most wines
have a residual sugar measurement around 2.2 g/dm^3.Also
we notice that we only had one point below at 0.900 g/dm^3.
This agrees with the documentation stating the rarity of red wines
with residual sugar less than 1 gram/liter

Next we will take a look at the alcohol content of each sample
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_4}
summary(wines$alcohol)
ggplot(wines, aes(alcohol))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(wines$alcohol), color ="blue")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = median(wines$alcohol), color='red')
